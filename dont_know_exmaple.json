    "description": "Our English cottage home located in the heart of Mont Albert/Box Hill is conveniently located only a few minutes from all that the area has to offer. Enjoy the gastronomy of local cafes and restaurants, or head to Box Hill Central nearby for your shopping and entertainment needs.\n\n[Welcome]\nWelcome to our English cottage themed home filled with historical charm. Upon entry, a cosy living room welcomes you. The space has been thoughtfully fitted, including a couch that can covert into a sofabed if required. The adjoining dining area can accommodate 6 and is perfect for your entertaining needs. The recently renovated kitchen is equipped with all the essentials you will require for your convenient and comfort. \nThe living room has an airconditioning unit for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use. We hope you enjoy our home as much as we do! \n\n[Bedrooms]\nTwo bedrooms contain queen-sized beds, and the third bedroom has a single-sized bed. Both beds come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year. The living room also has a sofabed which can be converted to accommodate the extra guest or two. \n\n[Sofabed]\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check-in. Last-minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\n[Bathroom]\nThere are two bathrooms in total and they are both prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. You are also welcomed to use the iron, washing machine and clothes dryer during your stay. Please note that the quantity of bathroom supplies provided will allow you to comfortably settle in for the initial few days of your stay.\n\n[Carpark]\nThe private garage can accommodate 2 cars. If you have additional cars with you, you may park along the street outside the property.\n\nGuests will have access to the entire home and parking is available on-site (a charge applies). \n\n\n[Check-in]\n- CHECK-IN: Standard check-in is between 3-9pm. \n\n[Check-out]\n- CHECK-OUT: Check-out is strictly by 10 am (LATE CHECK-OUTs WILL INCUR A FEE OF $100).\n\nOnce your booking has been confirmed, our housing manual will be sent to your email address, containing all information related to your booking. Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nLocated in the heart Mont Albert, our home is centrally located to offer you all that the area has to offer. Located a mere 5min drive from Box Hill Central, you will find a plethora of dining, shopping and entertainment options a short commute away.\n\nThere is a tram stop located outside the home that will take you to Box Hill Central or into the CBD. Mont Albert train station is a short 10min walk away.\n\n[Excess Rubbish]\nPlease dispose of excess rubbish in the big bins located outside the home.\n\n[Strict House Rules]\n- No smoking or drug use allowed (violation will incur a $500 fine).\n- No parties allowed.\n- No pets allowed.\n- The correct number of guests staying must be reflected in the booking. Linen and towels will only be provided for the number of guests included in the booking. \n- Please leave the property in a similar condition as it was during check-in. \n- Breakages, damages, theft and loss will be the guest's liability and responsibility.\n- Violation of any of the rules will result in a loss of your security deposit and/or additional charges.\n- As part of our verification procedure, a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie may be requested.\n- Noise levels are to be kept at an appropriate level at all times.\n- Please dispose of excess rubbish according to the rubbish disposal instructions located in the Housing Manual.\n- PLEASE USE THE RANGE HOOD WHEN COOKING so as to not set off the smoke alarm. \n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",
