      "description": "Our English cottage home located in the heart of Mont Albert/Box Hill is conveniently located only a few minutes from all that the area has to offer. Enjoy the gastronomy of local cafes and restaurants, or head to Box Hill Central nearby for your shopping and entertainment needs.\n\n[Welcome]\nWelcome to our English cottage themed home filled with historical charm. Upon entry, a cosy living room welcomes you. The space has been thoughtfully fitted, including a couch that can covert into a sofabed if required. The adjoining dining area can accommodate 6 and is perfect for your entertaining needs. The recently renovated kitchen is equipped with all the essentials you will require for your convenient and comfort. \nThe living room has an airconditioning unit for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use. We hope you enjoy our home as much as we do! \n\n[Bedrooms]\nTwo bedrooms contain queen-sized beds, and the third bedroom has a single-sized bed. Both beds come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year. The living room also has a sofabed which can be converted to accommodate the extra guest or two. \n\n[Sofabed]\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check-in. Last-minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\n[Bathroom]\nThere are two bathrooms in total and they are both prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. You are also welcomed to use the iron, washing machine and clothes dryer during your stay. Please note that the quantity of bathroom supplies provided will allow you to comfortably settle in for the initial few days of your stay.\n\n[Carpark]\nThe private garage can accommodate 2 cars. If you have additional cars with you, you may park along the street outside the property.\n\nGuests will have access to the entire home and parking is available on-site (a charge applies). \n\n\n[Check-in]\n- CHECK-IN: Standard check-in is between 3-9pm. \n\n[Check-out]\n- CHECK-OUT: Check-out is strictly by 10 am (LATE CHECK-OUTs WILL INCUR A FEE OF $100).\n\nOnce your booking has been confirmed, our housing manual will be sent to your email address, containing all information related to your booking. Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nLocated in the heart Mont Albert, our home is centrally located to offer you all that the area has to offer. Located a mere 5min drive from Box Hill Central, you will find a plethora of dining, shopping and entertainment options a short commute away.\n\nThere is a tram stop located outside the home that will take you to Box Hill Central or into the CBD. Mont Albert train station is a short 10min walk away.\n\n[Excess Rubbish]\nPlease dispose of excess rubbish in the big bins located outside the home.\n\n[Strict House Rules]\n- No smoking or drug use allowed (violation will incur a $500 fine).\n- No parties allowed.\n- No pets allowed.\n- The correct number of guests staying must be reflected in the booking. Linen and towels will only be provided for the number of guests included in the booking. \n- Please leave the property in a similar condition as it was during check-in. \n- Breakages, damages, theft and loss will be the guest's liability and responsibility.\n- Violation of any of the rules will result in a loss of your security deposit and/or additional charges.\n- As part of our verification procedure, a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie may be requested.\n- Noise levels are to be kept at an appropriate level at all times.\n- Please dispose of excess rubbish according to the rubbish disposal instructions located in the Housing Manual.\n- PLEASE USE THE RANGE HOOD WHEN COOKING so as to not set off the smoke alarm. \n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",

The space has been thoughtfully fitted, including a couch that can covert into a sofabed if required. The adjoining dining area can accommodate 6 and is perfect for your entertaining needs. The recently renovated kitchen is equipped with all the essentials you will require for your convenient and comfort. \nThe living room has an airconditioning unit for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use. We hope you enjoy our home as much as we do! \n\n[Bedrooms]\nTwo bedrooms contain queen-sized beds, and the third bedroom has a single-sized bed. Both beds come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year. The living room also has a sofabed which can be converted to accommodate the extra guest or two. \n\n[Sofabed]\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check-in. Last-minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\n[Bathroom]\nThere are two bathrooms in total and they are both prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. You are also welcomed to use the iron, washing machine and clothes dryer during your stay. Please note that the quantity of bathroom supplies provided will allow you to comfortably settle in for the initial few days of your stay.\n\n[Carpark]\nThe private garage can accommodate 2 cars. If you have additional cars with you, you may park along the street outside the property.",

Portraying a classical period exterior with an entirely contemporary interior, this home is the perfect base for professionals, friends, and families. Two bedrooms, each with their own bathroom, complement an invitingly open central living space, large dining/entertaining area , and a well-equipped modern kitchen.\n\n[Welcome]\nThis recently renovated single-level home located in the heart of Albert Park is your perfect Melbourne bayside getaway. The living room contains designer furnishings with the most comfortable sofa, and the kitchen is fully equipped and has been prepared with all the essential cooking equipment and utensils. The main entertaining space has large floor length glass doors that open up to the deck that bathe the space in warmth. Enjoy your morning coffees/teas or evening wines out on the deck or around the fireplace in the separate sitting room. Central heating and cooling is available throughout the home for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use.\n\n[Bedrooms]\nThe bedrooms each contain a queen bed with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year.\n\n[Bathrooms]\nThe bathrooms are prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. You are also welcome to use the hairdryer, iron and washing machine during your stay.

If the smoke alarm goes off, DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. Doing so will cause the fire truck to come to the apartment in which you will be fined heavily (approx. $1,500).\n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",

        "about": "Greetings fellow Jedi!\n\nMy name is Marini...\n\nStar Wars and Harry Potter nerd, a property developer, part-time property sales executive, and a passionate latin dancer!\n\nFood & dessert lover, who loves going to Victorian country side to harvest my own honey.. \n\nMost of my travels have been done either solo or with my best travel buddy (my super-cool-a-little-shopaholic Mama!). I love going to historic places, learning different cultures, visiting museums and admiring the architecture of different countries. \n\nMy favourite travel destinations so far are Japan and New York... and Europe!!! \nI recently just visited Europe with my Mama. We went to Milan, Lake Como, Turino, Geneva, Montreux, and Paris... my my my I knew Europe was pretty...but I was NOT expecting to fall head over heel with her!  And the soaps they have there.... heavenly!\n\nOur next trip is to visit Prague and Stockholm... I'm beyooonnddddd excitedddd!!!!\n\nMy style of travelling is definitely NOT to pack light. We have a big family and we can't leave anyone behind when it comes to gifts! I remember coming back from New York with my Mama with 12 suitcases.. all filled with gifts for our friends and family...LOL! Below is a very common conversation between myself and either the hotel concierge, or the taxi driver:\n\nConcierge/Driver: \"Are you travelling with your family, Miss?\"\nMe: \"Yes I am actually...*sheepishly* a family of 2\"  \nConcierge/Driver: \"WHHHATTTTTTT\"\n\nHAHAHHHAH!! Yup! Every. Single. Time.\n\nAnyways, my passion in life is to build relationships with the people around me. I love reading other people's success stories, and it makes me sooo happy when I see the people around me succeed in life. I strongly believe that when you share more in life, and the more you help others, the more generous life will be towards you... and I feel this in my life daily.\n\nSoooo.... lately I have been a little bit curious with DIY home projects... making truffle honey, homemade artisan soaps, and natural beauty products... So you might just get lucky and randomly get some home-made stuff from me when you book my place! LOL!\n\n\n",

The views from the balcony, coupled with all that Crown has to offer, indulge in the best of Melbourne's entertainment, dining and shopping to complete your ultimate Melbourne experience. The tram stop right at your doorstep conveniently takes you into the city and beyond.\n\n[Welcome]\nA thoughtfully furnished and fitted out open plan living, dining and kitchen area welcomes you upon entry. The spacious living area contains a three-seater couch, armchair and all that you need for a comfortable stay. The balcony has a small outdoor set for you to enjoy your morning coffees/teas or evening wines. The kitchen is equipped all the essentials you will require for your convenience and comfort. A 6-seater dining table set completes the space for all your entertaining needs. The living area comes with a split-system airconditioning unit for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter.

Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nLocated directly across from Crown Casino, you will have access to 24 hours of endless fun. For entertainment, Crown houses a world-class casino, cinema, arcade, bowling alley and more. It also has a large array of top notched restaurants and bars for you to choose from. To complete your indulgence, have a browse through the selection of luxury boutiques or head up to Crown spa for a massage or facial.

Enjoy Melbourne's famous cafes, restaurants, shopping and all that our beautiful city has to offer!\n\n[Excess Rubbish]\nPlease dispose of excess rubbish in the rubbish chute located near the lift.\n\n[Strict House Rules]\n- No smoking or drug use allowed (violation will incur a $500 fine).\n- No parties allowed.\n- No pets allowed.\n- The correct number of guests staying must be reflected in the booking. Linen and towels will only be provided for the number of guests included in the booking. \n- Please leave the property in a similar condition as it was during check-in. \n- Breakages, damages, theft and loss will be the guest's liability and responsibility.\n- Violation of any of the rules will result in a loss of your security deposit and/or additional charges.\n- As part of our verification procedure, a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie may be requested.\n- Noise levels are to be kept at an appropriate level at all times.\n- Please dispose of excess rubbish according to the rubbish disposal instructions located in the Housing Manual.\n- PLEASE USE THE RANGE HOOD WHEN COOKING so as to not set off the smoke alarm. If the smoke alarm goes off, DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. Doing so will cause the fire truck to come to the apartment in which you will be fined heavily (approx. $1,500).\n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",

I love going to historic places, learning different cultures, visiting museums and admiring the architecture of different countries. \n\nMy favourite travel destinations so far are Japan and New York... and Europe!!! \nI recently just visited Europe with my Mama. We went to Milan, Lake Como, Turino, Geneva, Montreux, and Paris... my my my I knew Europe was pretty...but I was NOT expecting to fall head over heel with her!  And the soaps they have there.... heavenly!\n\nOur next trip is to visit Prague and Stockholm... I'm beyooonnddddd excitedddd!!!!\n\nMy style of travelling is definitely NOT to pack light. We have a big family and we can't leave anyone behind when it comes to gifts! I remember coming back from New York with my Mama with 12 suitcases.. all filled with gifts for our friends and family...LOL! Below is a very common conversation between myself and either the hotel concierge, or the taxi driver:\n\nConcierge/Driver: \"Are you travelling with your family, Miss?\"\nMe: \"Yes I am actually...*sheepishly* a family of 2\"  \nConcierge/Driver: \"WHHHATTTTTTT\"\n\nHAHAHHHAH!! Yup! Every. Single. Time.\n\nAnyways, my passion in life is to build relationships with the people around me. I love reading other people's success stories, and it makes me sooo happy when I see the people around me succeed in life. I strongly believe that when you share more in life, and the more you help others, the more generous life will be towards you... and I feel this in my life daily.\n\nSoooo.... lately I have been a little bit curious with DIY home projects... making truffle honey, homemade artisan soaps, and natural beauty products... So you might just get lucky and randomly get some home-made stuff from me when you book my place! LOL!\n\n\n",

          "about": "Greetings fellow Jedi!\n\nMy name is Marini...\n\nStar Wars and Harry Potter nerd, a property developer, part-time property sales executive, and a passionate latin dancer!\n\nFood & dessert lover, who loves going to Victorian country side to harvest my own honey.. \n\nMost of my travels have been done either solo or with my best travel buddy (my super-cool-a-little-shopaholic Mama!). I love going to historic places, learning different cultures, visiting museums and admiring the architecture of different countries. \n\nMy favourite travel destinations so far are Japan and New York... and Europe!!! \nI recently just visited Europe with my Mama. We went to Milan, Lake Como, Turino, Geneva, Montreux, and Paris... my my my I knew Europe was pretty...but I was NOT expecting to fall head over heel with her!  And the soaps they have there.... heavenly!\n\nOur next trip is to visit Prague and Stockholm... I'm beyooonnddddd excitedddd!!!!\n\nMy style of travelling is definitely NOT to pack light. We have a big family and we can't leave anyone behind when it comes to gifts! I remember coming back from New York with my Mama with 12 suitcases.. all filled with gifts for our friends and family...LOL! Below is a very common conversation between myself and either the hotel concierge, or the taxi driver:\n\nConcierge/Driver: \"Are you travelling with your family, Miss?\"\nMe: \"Yes I am actually...*sheepishly* a family of 2\"  \nConcierge/Driver: \"WHHHATTTTTTT\"\n\nHAHAHHHAH!! Yup! Every. Single. Time.\n\nAnyways, my passion in life is to build relationships with the people around me. I love reading other people's success stories, and it makes me sooo happy when I see the people around me succeed in life. I strongly believe that when you share more in life, and the more you help others, the more generous life will be towards you... and I feel this in my life daily.\n\nSoooo.... lately I have been a little bit curious with DIY home projects... making truffle honey, homemade artisan soaps, and natural beauty products... So you might just get lucky and randomly get some home-made stuff from me when you book my place! LOL!\n\n\n",
