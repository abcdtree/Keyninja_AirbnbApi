        "description": "Our English cottage home located in the heart of Mont Albert/Box Hill is conveniently located only a few minutes from all that the area has to offer. Enjoy the gastronomy of local cafes and restaurants, or head to Box Hill Central nearby for your shopping and entertainment needs.\n\n[Welcome]\nWelcome to our English cottage themed home filled with historical charm. Upon entry, a cosy living room welcomes you. The space has been thoughtfully fitted, including a couch that can covert into a sofabed if required. The adjoining dining area can accommodate 6 and is perfect for your entertaining needs. The recently renovated kitchen is equipped with all the essentials you will require for your convenient and comfort. \nThe living room has an airconditioning unit for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use. We hope you enjoy our home as much as we do! \n\n[Bedrooms]\nTwo bedrooms contain queen-sized beds, and the third bedroom has a single-sized bed. Both beds come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year. The living room also has a sofabed which can be converted to accommodate the extra guest or two. \n\n[Sofabed]\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check-in. Last-minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\n[Bathroom]\nThere are two bathrooms in total and they are both prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. You are also welcomed to use the iron, washing machine and clothes dryer during your stay. Please note that the quantity of bathroom supplies provided will allow you to comfortably settle in for the initial few days of your stay.\n\n[Carpark]\nThe private garage can accommodate 2 cars. If you have additional cars with you, you may park along the street outside the property.\n\nGuests will have access to the entire home and parking is available on-site (a charge applies). \n\n\n[Check-in]\n- CHECK-IN: Standard check-in is between 3-9pm. \n\n[Check-out]\n- CHECK-OUT: Check-out is strictly by 10 am (LATE CHECK-OUTs WILL INCUR A FEE OF $100).\n\nOnce your booking has been confirmed, our housing manual will be sent to your email address, containing all information related to your booking. Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nLocated in the heart Mont Albert, our home is centrally located to offer you all that the area has to offer. Located a mere 5min drive from Box Hill Central, you will find a plethora of dining, shopping and entertainment options a short commute away.\n\nThere is a tram stop located outside the home that will take you to Box Hill Central or into the CBD. Mont Albert train station is a short 10min walk away.\n\n[Excess Rubbish]\nPlease dispose of excess rubbish in the big bins located outside the home.\n\n[Strict House Rules]\n- No smoking or drug use allowed (violation will incur a $500 fine).\n- No parties allowed.\n- No pets allowed.\n- The correct number of guests staying must be reflected in the booking. Linen and towels will only be provided for the number of guests included in the booking. \n- Please leave the property in a similar condition as it was during check-in. \n- Breakages, damages, theft and loss will be the guest's liability and responsibility.\n- Violation of any of the rules will result in a loss of your security deposit and/or additional charges.\n- As part of our verification procedure, a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie may be requested.\n- Noise levels are to be kept at an appropriate level at all times.\n- Please dispose of excess rubbish according to the rubbish disposal instructions located in the Housing Manual.\n- PLEASE USE THE RANGE HOOD WHEN COOKING so as to not set off the smoke alarm. \n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",

The space has been thoughtfully fitted, including a couch that can covert into a sofabed if required. The adjoining dining area can accommodate 6 and is perfect for your entertaining needs. The recently renovated kitchen is equipped with all the essentials you will require for your convenient and comfort. \nThe living room has an airconditioning unit for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use. We hope you enjoy our home as much as we do! \n\n[Bedrooms]\nTwo bedrooms contain queen-sized beds, and the third bedroom has a single-sized bed. Both beds come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year. The living room also has a sofabed which can be converted to accommodate the extra guest or two. \n\n[Sofabed]\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check-in. Last-minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\n[Bathroom]\nThere are two bathrooms in total and they are both prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. You are also welcomed to use the iron, washing machine and clothes dryer during your stay. Please note that the quantity of bathroom supplies provided will allow you to comfortably settle in for the initial few days of your stay.\n\n[Carpark]\nThe private garage can accommodate 2 cars. If you have additional cars with you, you may park along the street outside the property.",

        "description": "Located across the Carlton Gardens and Melbourne Museum, find yourself near fresh greenery and seasonal exhibitions waiting for you to explore. With a tram stop right at your doorstep, you have easy access to all parts of the CBD and begin exploring the shopping districts, restaurants, cafes and Melbourne's iconic laneways.\n\nA spacious open plan living, dining and kitchen area welcomes you upon entry. The living area has been carefully fitted out to ensure that you will have an enjoyable stay. One of the sofas can be converted into a sofabed for that extra guest or two. The kitchen is also fully fitted out with all the basic cooking items, including a kettle, microwave, gas stovetop, electric oven, toaster, cutlery and dining ware. A 6-seater dining table set completes the space for all your entertaining needs. To ensure you have a comfortable stay, there is a wall-mounted electric heater for you to warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use.\n\n\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check in. Last minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\n\nThe two bedrooms each contain a queen-sized bed, both of which come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year.\n\nThe bathroom is prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. You are also welcome to use the hairdryer, iron, washing machine and clothes dryer during your stay. Please note that the quantity of bathroom supplies provided will allow you to comfortably settle in for the initial few days of your stay.\n\n1 free carpark is also included with your stay.\n\nGuest will have access to the entire home and parking if available on-site.\n\n[Check-in]\n- CHECK-IN: Standard check-in is between 3-9pm. \n- Check-ins between 9pm-midnight will incur a late check-in fee of $25. \n-Check-ins after midnight will incur a late check-in fee of $50.\n*We will require you to present a valid photo ID matching the booking at the time of check-in.*\n\n[Check-out]\n- CHECK-OUT: Check-out is strictly by 10 am (LATE CHECK-OUTs WILL INCUR A FEE OF $100).\n\nOnce your booking has been confirmed, our housing manual will be sent to your email address, containing all information related to your booking. Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nFind yourself across the Carlton Gardens, Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne Museum and right off Melbourne's iconic CBD filled with hundreds of shops and restaurants. This home is perfect for those who like to start their morning with a walk in the park, followed by exploring all that Melbourne city (and its suburbs) has to offer.\n\nThere is a tram stop located in front of this apartment that takes you directly into the city and to Melbourne Central Station for those who want to travel out of the city by train. Free parking is also available at this accommodation.\n\n[Excess Rubbish]\nPlease dispose of excess rubbish in the rubbish chute located near the lift.\n\n[Strict House Rules]\n- No smoking or drug use allowed (violation will incur a $500 fine).\n- No parties allowed.\n- No pets allowed.\n- The correct number of guests staying must be reflected in the booking. Linen and towels will only be provided for the number of guests included in the booking. \n- Please leave the property in a similar condition as it was during check-in. \n- Breakages, damages, theft and loss will be the guest's liability and responsibility.\n- Violation of any of the rules will result in a loss of your security deposit and/or additional charges.\n- As part of our verification procedure, a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie may be requested.\n- Noise levels are to be kept at an appropriate level at all times.\n- Please dispose of excess rubbish according to the rubbish disposal instructions located in the Housing Manual.\n- PLEASE USE THE RANGE HOOD WHEN COOKING so as to not set off the smoke alarm. If the smoke alarm goes off, DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. Doing so will cause the fire truck to come to the apartment in which you will be fined heavily (approx. $1,500).\n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",

        "description": "Our bright and airy two-bedroom home is tucked away in the cosy and quiet suburb of North Melbourne with a straight tram ride into the heart of Melbourne's iconic CBD. The house is charmingly furnished, decorated and equipped to make you feel right at home no matter how long or short your trip is. Find yourself located near the Melbourne Zoo, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Royal Park and a 2-minute walk away from the tram stop on Flemington Road for you to explore all that Melbourne has to offer.\n\n[Welcome]\nThe living room contains beautiful timber floorboards and tasteful decorations to make you feel right at home. You will find two comfortable sofas (one of which converts into a single sofa bed for that extra guest) and a 6-seater dining table for you to entertain during your stay. To complete your stay, we have equipped the kitchen with essential cooking items, including necessary crockery, cutlery, kettle, microwave, toaster and dining ware. We also have a courtyard located in the centre of the house with a pond where you can watch our fishes swim around, as well as a quiet patio around the back of the house for you to relax and breathe in the fresh air. The home has split-system airconditioning units for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use.\n\n[Bedrooms]\nThe master bedroom has a queen-sized bed, while the second bedroom contains a double-sized bed. All beds come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year.\n\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check in. Last minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\n[Bathrooms]\nThe main bathroom is located upstairs and will be prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. Downstairs you will find an additional toilet (no shower). You are also welcome to use the hairdryer, iron and washing machine during your stay. Please note that the quantity of bathroom supplies provided will allow you to comfortably settle in for the initial few days of your stay.\n\n[Carpark]\nYou will be able to park 1 car in the garage.\n\n[Wifi]\nFree WIFI is available in the apartment throughout your stay. WIFI details will be provided to you i\n\nGuest will have access to the entire home and parking if available on-site.\n\n[Check-in]\n- CHECK-IN: Standard check-in is between 3-9pm. \n- Check-ins between 9pm-midnight will incur a late check-in fee of $25. \n-Check-ins after midnight will incur a late check-in fee of $50.\n*We will require you to present a valid photo ID matching the booking at the time of check-in.*\n\n[Check-out]\n- CHECK-OUT: Check-out is strictly by 10 am (LATE CHECK-OUTs WILL INCUR A FEE OF $100).\n\nOnce your booking has been confirmed, our housing manual will be sent to your email address, containing all information related to your booking. Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nFind yourself located near the Melbourne Zoo, Royal Melbourne Hospital and Royal Park with easy access to the University of Melbourne and a straight tram ride into the city that is filled with hundreds of restaurants and shops for you to explore. There is also a Woolworths Supermarket located at Newmarket Plaza that is a 5-minute drive away!\n\nThe nearest tram stop is located 5 minutes away by foot on Flemington Road. This gives you access to the city via tram number 57 or 59, and access to Flemington Bridge Train Station via tram number 59. For those with a car, there is one free secure and sheltered parking available on the premises.\n\n[Excess Rubbish]\nPlease dispose of excess rubbish in the rubbish chute located near the lift.\n\n[Strict House Rules]\n- No smoking or drug use allowed (violation will incur a $500 fine).\n- No parties allowed.\n- No pets allowed.\n- The correct number of guests staying must be reflected in the booking. Linen and towels will only be provided for the number of guests included in the booking. \n- Please leave the property in a similar condition as it was during check-in. \n- Breakages, damages, theft and loss will be the guest's liability and responsibility.\n- Violation of any of the rules will result in a loss of your security deposit and/or additional charges.\n- As part of our verification procedure, a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie may be requested.\n- Noise levels are to be kept at an appropriate level at all times.\n- Please dispose of excess rubbish according to the rubbish disposal instructions located in the Housing Manual.\n- PLEASE USE THE RANGE HOOD WHEN COOKING so as to not set off the smoke alarm. If the smoke alarm goes off, DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. Doing so will cause the fire truck to come to the apartment in which you will be fined heavily (approx. $1,500).\n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",

The State Library, Chinatown, Melbourne Central and Emporium shopping centres, QV, Bourke Street shopping strip and iconic Lygon Street are right at your doorstep or only a short walk away. The location, coupled with the expansive views from this 36th floor apartment, is the perfect holiday home for exploring Melbourne CBD and beyond!\n\n[Welcome]\nThis apartment is the perfect base for your Melbourne adventures. Recently completed, this 2 bedroom apartment has been stylishly furnished with comfort in mind. Featuring an open plan living and dining area, the space contains a sofabed (for that additional guest if you require it), 4-seater dining set, and a fully equipped kitchen with all the essential items you will require for your entertaining needs. Soak in the expansive views from the attached balcony whilst you enjoy your morning coffee/tea or evening wine. The living area comes with a split-system airconditioning unit for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter.

        "description": "This recently renovated apartment, situated only a short walk from the Botanical Gardens, Shrine of Remembrance and Melbourne's art precinct, is the perfect location for your Melbourne getaway. Coupled with famous cafes like Kettle Black and The Crux & Co. around the corner, indulge in Melbourne's famous brunches and coffee to complete your ultimate Melbourne experience. The tram stop right at your doorstep takes you into the city for all your shopping needs or to St Kilda beach.\n\nA thoughtfully furnished and fitted out open plan living, dining and kitchen area welcomes you upon entry. The living area contains two leather sofas and all that you need for a comfortable stay. The balcony has a small outdoor set for you to enjoy your morning coffees/teas or evening wines. A 6-seater dining table set completes the space for all your entertaining needs. The living area comes with a split-system airconditioning unit for you to cool down in summer or warm up in winter. As we are environmentally conscious, we would greatly appreciate it if you ensure it is turned off when not in use.\n\n\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check in. Last minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\n\nThe two bedrooms each contain a queen-sized bed, both of which come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year.\n\n\nThe bathroom is prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay. Toilet paper and bath towels are also included. You are also welcome to use the hairdryer, iron, washing machine and clothes dryer during your stay. Please note that the quantity of bathroom supplies provided will allow you to comfortably settle in for the initial few days of your stay.\n\n\n1 free carpark is also included with your stay.\n\n\nThis apartment is located close to Albert Park where the Grand Prix and Australian Tennis Open take place each year.\n\nGuest will have access to the entire home and parking if available on-site.\n\n[Check-in]\n- CHECK-IN: Standard check-in is between 3-9pm. \n- Check-ins between 9pm-midnight will incur a late check-in fee of $25. \n-Check-ins after midnight will incur a late check-in fee of $50.\n*We will require you to present a valid photo ID matching the booking at the time of check-in.*\n\n[Check-out]\n- CHECK-OUT: Check-out is strictly by 10 am (LATE CHECK-OUTs WILL INCUR A FEE OF $100).\n\nOnce your booking has been confirmed, our housing manual will be sent to your email address, containing all information related to your booking. Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nSt Kilda Road is a quiet, tree-lined boulevard with public transport on the doorstep and just minutes from the city. Take a stroll through the beautiful Albert Park Lake, explore the nearby Royal Botanical Gardens and Shrine of Rememberance, or head to the beautiful St. Kilda beach some beautiful sun, sand, and sea.\n\nTram stop right in front of the apartment which is a huge bonus and it takes you straight to Swanston St in the heart of the CBD.\nIt is also right opposite the Botanical Gardens and only 5-min from the National Gallery of Victoria, Flinders Street station, and Federation Square - all major tourist attractions.\n\n[Excess Rubbish]\nPlease dispose of excess rubbish in the rubbish chute located near the lift.\n\n[Strict House Rules]\n- No smoking or drug use allowed (violation will incur a $500 fine).\n- No parties allowed.\n- No pets allowed.\n- The correct number of guests staying must be reflected in the booking. Linen and towels will only be provided for the number of guests included in the booking. \n- Please leave the property in a similar condition as it was during check-in. \n- Breakages, damages, theft and loss will be the guest's liability and responsibility.\n- Violation of any of the rules will result in a loss of your security deposit and/or additional charges.\n- As part of our verification procedure, a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie may be requested.\n- Noise levels are to be kept at an appropriate level at all times.\n- Please dispose of excess rubbish according to the rubbish disposal instructions located in the Housing Manual.\n- PLEASE USE THE RANGE HOOD WHEN COOKING so as to not set off the smoke alarm. If the smoke alarm goes off, DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. Doing so will cause the fire truck to come to the apartment in which you will be fined heavily (approx. $1,500).\n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",

Separate from the living room is an outdoor area with outdoor seating ideal for lounging throughout the day.\n\n[Sofabed]\nLinen and blanket for the sofabed will only be provided upon request. This request will need to be put in at least 24 hours before check in. Last minute requests for sofa bed linen will incur an additional surcharge of $30.\n\nBedrooms]\nTwo bedrooms each contain a queen-sized bed whilst the third bedroom contains two single beds. All beds come with clean and freshly pressed linen and all-seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year.\n\n[Bathrooms]\nThe bathrooms are prepared with complimentary body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for your stay.

Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nWe live within a quick walk to the Niddrie Lake.

If the smoke alarm goes off, DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. Doing so will cause the fire truck to come to the apartment in which you will be fined heavily (approx. $1,500).\n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay.

        "description": "This is the most affordable, luxurious, and spacious apartment in the Heart of Melbourne without having to sacrifice privacy.\n\nWith a Walk Score of 100/100, my home is surrounded by Melbourne's Top Restaurants, Cafes, Bars, Shopping and Entertainment. Whether it be Melbourne's secret hidden laneways, late night hotspots, day-time activities, or education institutions, my place is at the Heart of it all!\n\nOh, and Melbourne's best Karaoke at K-Box is next door!\n\nThe LIVING ROOM contains a comfortable sofa, a 4-seater dining set, a big screen TV, coffee table and comfy cushions. We have amazing city views. There is a heating and air-conditioning unit in the living room, but please switch it off when not in use, we deeply appreciate it!\n\nThe BEDROOMS come with clean luxury linens and all seasons quilts to keep you warm throughout the year. The main bedroom contains a queen sized bed, and the second bedroom a double bed. Both bedrooms come with high quality mattresses and comfortable bedding. There is sufficient storage space for your belongings and hangers for your clothes.\n\nThe BATHROOMS are stocked with body wash, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner for you and your group. We also provide toilet paper and bath towels. In the bathroom there is also a washing machine and dryer, detergent, an iron and an ironing board.\n\nThe KITCHEN is fully equipped with basic cooking items, such as pots and pans, kettle, microwave, gas stovetop, oven, toaster, cutlery, dining ware and some basic condiments for you to use.\n\nFree WIFI throughout your stay, available in all rooms. The WIFI details are in the manual provided.\n\nGuest will have access to the entire home.\n\n[Check-in]\n- CHECK-IN: Standard check-in is between 3-9pm. \n- Check-ins between 9pm-midnight will incur a late check-in fee of $25. \n-Check-ins after midnight will incur a late check-in fee of $50.\n*We will require you to present a valid photo ID matching the booking at the time of check-in.*\n\n[Check-out]\n- CHECK-OUT: Check-out is strictly by 10 am (LATE CHECK-OUTs WILL INCUR A FEE OF $100).\n\nOnce your booking has been confirmed, our housing manual will be sent to your email address, containing all information related to your booking. Please refer to that for check-in and check-out instructions.\n\nOngoing communication is best via the platform or through the phone number provided. Please provide us with your name and reservation address if you do call us, and we'll be at your assistance.\n\nThe location is ideal for all travellers with Russell Street downstairs, 2-min walk to Melbourne Central Station (hotspot) and Chinatown (hotspot), a 5-min walk to Queen Victoria Market, access to Elizabeth Street's Asian eateries, Melbourne's GPO and Hardware Lane are down the road, Emporium and Flinders Street are a free tram-ride away.\n\nWe highly recommend walking next-door to K-Box for an affordable Karaoke session with some drinks any night of the week!\n\nI would definitely walk everywhere! How else would you get to see all of Melbourne's laneways, alleys, side streets and hidden spots? But if you want, there is free tram access in all directions on La Trobe Street and down on Swanston Street, as well as Melbourne Central's Train Station just a 5-7 minute walk away!\n\n[Excess Rubbish]\nPlease dispose of excess rubbish in the rubbish chute located near the lift.\n\n[Strict House Rules]\n- No smoking or drug use allowed (violation will incur a $500 fine).\n- No parties allowed.\n- No pets allowed.\n- The correct number of guests staying must be reflected in the booking. Linen and towels will only be provided for the number of guests included in the booking. \n- Please leave the property in a similar condition as it was during check-in. \n- Breakages, damages, theft and loss will be the guest's liability and responsibility.\n- Violation of any of the rules will result in a loss of your security deposit and/or additional charges.\n- As part of our verification procedure, a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie may be requested.\n- Noise levels are to be kept at an appropriate level at all times.\n- Please dispose of excess rubbish according to the rubbish disposal instructions located in the Housing Manual.\n- PLEASE USE THE RANGE HOOD WHEN COOKING so as to not set off the smoke alarm. If the smoke alarm goes off, DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. Doing so will cause the fire truck to come to the apartment in which you will be fined heavily (approx. $1,500).\n- We provide a set of toiletries to ensure you are settled in well for the initial period of your stay. Regrettably, we are unable to provide re-stocks or refills of these toiletries if you have a longer stay. You may, however, request for housekeeping during your stay at additional cost.\n\n[LOST & FOUND]\n-Lost items will be kept in our office for 1 week. $50 will be charged for postage to mail the item back to you upon request.",
